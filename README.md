# RESTful-API
An RESTful-API adhering to  REST architecture. 

## How does it work? 

REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example... 

* A REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record,
* A POST request to create one, 
* A PUT request to update a record,
* And a DELETE request to delete one. 

All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
